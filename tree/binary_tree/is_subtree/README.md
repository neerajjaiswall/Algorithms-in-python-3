Given two binary trees s and t, check if t is a subtree of s.
A subtree of a tree t is a tree consisting of a node in t and
all of its descendants in t.

Example 1:

Given s:
```
    3
  /   \
 4     5
/  \
1   2
```
Given t:

  4
/   \
1   2
Return true, because t is a subtree of s.

Example 2:

Given s:
```
      3
    /   \
    4   5
  /  \
  1   2
  /
 0
```
Given t:
```
    3
   /
  4
 / \
1   2
```
Return false, because even though t is part of s,
it does not contain all descendants of t.
