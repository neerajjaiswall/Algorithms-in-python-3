Given an array arr[0..n-1] of distinct elements and a range [low, high], find all numbers that are in range, but not in array. The missing elements should be printed in sorted order.


Input: arr[] = {10, 12, 11, 15}, 
       low = 10, hight = 15
Output: 13, 14

Input: arr[] = {1, 14, 11, 51, 15}, 
       low = 50, hight = 55
Output: 50, 52, 53, 54
